# VARIANT 2. MARKETING ANALYTICS

## BUSINESS PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

A company that manufactures and sells electronic devices recently launched an advertising campaign to promote a new product – smart watches. The target audience of the campaign is young professionals aged 25-40, living in large cities, actively using modern technologies and leading a healthy lifestyle. The manager wants to understand whether the advertising campaign was successful and evaluate its impact on sales and return on investment (ROI).

## DATA ANALYSIS APPROACH
• Key marketing metrics:

o Conversion Rate – the percentage of users who made a purchase after interacting with an advertisement. Calculated as the ratio of the number of sales to the number of users who saw the advertisement.

o Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) – the sum of advertising costs divided by the number of new customers acquired through the campaign. Focus on business metrics such as sales volume generated during the campaign period and average purchase value.

• Additional data for analysis:

o Demographic information about customers (age, gender, location), which can help identify the most successful target groups.

o Data on advertising channels (social networks, search engines, display advertising), to understand which channels brought in more conversions.

o Sales dynamics before and after the launch of the campaign to assess the effect of advertising on customer behavior.
